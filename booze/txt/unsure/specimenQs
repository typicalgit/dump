1. The Licensing Act 2003
The history of licensing
The introduction of licensing laws
dates back to the Gin Act 1751,
which was introduced due to the
‘gin craze’ in Britain, when the
production of gin increased to
six times that of beer. Under the
Gin Act, gin makers were forced
to sell to licensed premises and
control of these premises by the
local magistrates was introduced.
In the 19th century, licensing
hours were gradually imposed,
with additional restrictions on
opening hours being introduced
during World War I. However,
over the years these restrictions
were relaxed.

The Licensing Act 2003
The Licensing Act 2003, which
came into force in November
2005, replaced all previous
licensing laws and moved the
responsibility for licensing away
from the local magistrates
to the local authorities. A
single integrated system was
introduced throughout England
and Wales to regulate the sale
and supply of alcohol, the
provision of entertainment to
the public and the provision
of late-night refreshment. The
act also includes the statutory
requirement that all retail sales
of alcohol must be made, or
4

authorised by, a personal licence
holder. In addition, premises
which are licensed for the sale of
alcohol must have a Designated
Premises Supervisor (DPS)
appointed. This DPS must be a
personal licence holder.

Licensing objectives
There are four licensing
objectives under the Licensing
Act 2003. You must know what
they are as each objective
is important and forms the
structure of the licensing law.
To demonstrate support for
the licensing objectives it is
advisable that staff are properly
trained and qualified in
licensing law.
You must promote the licensing
objectives at all times in
your business.

The four licensing
objectives are:
1. Prevention
of crime
and disorder

2. Public
Safety

3. Prevention of
public nuisance

4. Protection
of children
from harm

Licensable activities
There are four licensing activities under the Licensing Act 2003:
1. Sale of alcohol by retail
2. Supply of alcohol on club premises
3. Provision of regulated entertainment
4. Late-night refreshment.
The sale of alcohol by retail is the only licensable activity that
requires a personal licence holder (PLH) and Designated Premises
Supervisor (DPS).

Sale of alcohol by retail
This is the sale of alcohol to any
person except in the following
situations:
i. To a trader for the purpose
of their trade. For example
the sale of wine by a
distributor to a supermarket
is not classed as a sale of
alcohol by retail
ii. To a members’ club
iii. To a personal or premises
licence holder for the
purposes of making sales
according to the terms of a
premises licence

iv. To a premises user who has
a Temporary Event Notice
for the purpose of making
sales authorised by that
notice.
For the sale of alcohol by retail
a premises must have:
At least one personal
licence holder (PLH)
A named Designated
Premises Supervisor (DPS)
(this person must be a PLH)
A premises licence
5

It is a mandatory condition
that all sales of alcohol are
authorised by a personal
licence holder.
In some premises there
may only be one personal
licence holder who is also the
Designated Premises Supervisor.
In others there may be multiple
personal licence holders;
however, there will still only be
one DPS.

Supply of alcohol on
club premises

Provision of regulated
entertainment
Regulated entertainment consists
of providing certain entertainment
for an audience or spectators. The
following activities are examples
of regulated entertainment:
a.

b.

There are a wide variety of clubs
that exist which include:
i. Political-based members’
clubs
ii. Working men’s clubs
iii. Sports and social clubs.
Technically no sale to a member
actually takes place on club
premises because the members
of the club own the alcohol, and
for this reason such transactions
are referred to as ‘supply of
alcohol’.

c.

d.

To supply alcohol on a club
premises, the premises must
have a club premises certificate.
However, no personal licence
holder, premises licence or DPS
is required.

e.
6

Performance of a play where
there is an audience of more
than 500 people and/or the
performance takes place
before 08:00 or after 23:00
Indoor sporting event
(excluding boxing or
wrestling) where there is
an audience of more than
1,000 people and/or the

of more than 500 people;
the performance takes
place before 08:00; the
performance takes place after
23:00; the entertainment
is defined as relevant
entertainment by the Local
Government Act 1982 (i.e.
it involves live display or
performance of nudity for
the purposes of sexually
stimulating any member of
the audience
Exhibition of a film

f.

Boxing or wrestling
entertainment, whether
indoor or outdoor, including
combined fighting sports
where boxing or wrestling is
combined with one or more
martial arts.

Even if no charge has been
made, regulated entertainment
will still be classed as a
licensable activity. However,
there are some activities that
are not classed as regulated
entertainment, including:
a.

Games such as pool, darts
etc. (unless the game is
staged for spectators, for
example a celebrity
darts match)
b. Morris dancing
c. Music used in a religious
ceremony
d. Background music.
Live music, whether amplified
or unamplified, or the playing
of recorded music, will not
be classed as regulated
entertainment as long as all
the following conditions
are satisfied:
a. There is a premises licence
or club premises certificate
in place permitting the
sale or supply of alcohol
for consumption on the
premises,
b. The premises are open for
the sale or supply of alcohol
for consumption on the
premises,

c.

The music is being
performed between 08:00
and 23:00, and
d. In the case of amplified live
music, the audience consists
of no more than 500 people.

Live music will also not
be classed as regulated
entertainment if:
a. The live music is unamplified
and is performed between
08:00 and 23:00 regardless
of where the music is
performed or the size of
the audience
b. The live music is performed
in a workplace (as defined
by the Workplace (Health,
Safety and Welfare)
Regulations 1992) which
is not licensed under the
Licensing Act 2003 (with the
exception for the provision of
late-night refreshment) and
the performance takes place
between the hours of 08:00
and 23:00 to an audience of
no more than 500 people.
If different activities with
different audience thresholds
are taking place at the same
premises at the same time,
organisers must ensure that the
audience for each activity does
not exceed the relevant limits
unless the correct licence is
in place.
In order to provide regulated
entertainment, a premises
must have a premises licence
7

which authorises such activity.
TheMusicLicence from PPL PRS
Limited (previously Phonographic
Performance Limited and
Performing Right Society) may
also be required and if alcohol
is to be sold there must also
be at least one personal licence
holder and a named Designated
Premises Supervisor.

Provision of
late‑night refreshment
The provision of late-night
refreshment is the supply of hot
food or hot drink to members of
the public between the hours of
23:00 and 05:00; this applies
for consumption both on and off
the premises. Examples are:
i. Pubs and restaurants
ii. Burger and kebab vans
iii. Service stations
iv. Cafes and food takeaways.
For the provision of late-night
refreshment a premises must
have:

Types of licences
There are two types of licence
under the Licensing Act 2003:
A Personal Licence:
allows a person to sell, or
authorise the sale of, alcohol. Any
sale, or authorisation of sale, must
be in accordance with the terms
of the premises licence for the
premises where the sale is made.
A Premises Licence:
authorises a premises to be
used for one or more of the
licensable activities.

Licensing authorities
Alcohol and entertainment
licensing in each area of England
and Wales is the responsibility of
the local licensing authority, which
deals with all licensing matters.

A licensing authority can be any
one of the following bodies:

Licensing hearings
and appeals

a. A district council in England
b. A county council in England,
where there are no separate
districts within the county
c. A county council or county
borough in Wales
d. The council of each London
borough
e. The common council of the
city of London
f. The council of the Isles of
Scilly.

Licensing hearings may take
place if there have been
objections or issues determining
applications:

Each licensing authority must
publish a Statement of Licensing
Policy, setting out how that
authority intends to promote the
licensing objectives. A licensing
committee considers the licensing
policies in relation to deciding
whether to grant a licence or not.
Each licensing authority appoints
a licensing committee consisting
of at least 10, but no more than
15, elected council members. A
licensing officer may deal with
some of the committee’s tasks,
such as dealing with premises and
personal licence applications.
Every licensing authority must
keep a register that contains:
i. A record of every premises
licence, personal licence and
club premises certificate
issued
ii. A record of every Temporary
Event Notice (TEN) received
iii. A record of all notices and
applications.

i. To grant, transfer, review or
vary a premises licence
ii. To grant, review or vary a
club premises certificate
iii. To grant a personal licence.
A hearing may also be held if an
objection is made in relation to
the issue of a Temporary Event
Notice (TEN).
Following a hearing to consider
a personal licence application
the licence will be refused if
the licensing authority agrees
with the objection notice issued
by the Chief Officer of Police
or Home Office (Immigration
Enforcement) on the grounds
that it would undermine the
crime prevention licensing
objective.
If any party remains unsatisfied
by the decision made at a
hearing, they can challenge the
authority’s decision through an
appeal to a magistrates’ court.
Appeals must be made within
21 days of the applicant being
notified of the decision by the
licensing authority.

Partnership working
Partnerships are vital to making sure that the licensing objectives
are being met and promoted. A premises licence holder can show
support for the licensing objectives by working in partnership with
the authorities and other organisations.
There are many partnerships that work together to ensure the
smooth running and ongoing operations of the licensing process.

Chief Officer
of Police
Representatives
of local club
premises
certificate
holders

Representatives
of local premises
licence holders

3. Personal Licence
A personal licence allows a
person to sell, or authorise the
sale of, alcohol in England and
Wales. Where a personal licence
holder authorises others to sell
alcohol, records should be kept
of these authorisations. These
records can then be used as
evidence of due diligence should
the need arise.
All sales must be made in
accordance with the terms of the

premises licence where the sale
is taking place.
A person does not need to be
working in licensed premises
to hold a personal licence, and
an individual can hold only one
personal licence.
The application for a personal
licence must be made to the
licensing authority where
you live.
i.

To apply for a
personal licence
you must:

Be 18 or over and entitled
to work in the UK
ii. Possess a relevant qualification,
e.g. the BIIAB Level 2 Award for

Determination and grant
of a personal licence
The local authority must grant
a personal licence application
if the applicant meets all of the
following criteria:
Criterion 1
The applicant is aged 18 or over
and entitled to work in the UK.
Criterion 2
The applicant possesses a
relevant accredited licensing
qualification such as the BIIAB
APLH (or NCPLH if taken before
31/3/2011).
Criterion 3
The applicant has not forfeited a
personal licence in the last
five years.
Criterion 4
Declare any convictions of a
relevant or foreign offence or
payment of an immigration
penalty.
The licensing authority must
inform both the applicant and
the Chief Officer of Police for the
area, in writing, that the licence
has been granted.
If the applicant fails to meet
1, 2 or 3 above, then the
licensing authority must reject
the application. If an applicant
has had their personal licence
forfeited or revoked they cannot
apply for a personal licence for a
period of five years.

If the applicant meets 1, 2 and 3
above, but fails to meet criterion
4, the licensing authority must
notify the Chief Officer of Police
for the area and/or Home Office
(Immigration Enforcement).
The police or Home Office
(Immigration Enforcement) have
the power to object to someone
having a personal licence if
that person fails to meet the
relevant or foreign offence or
immigration penalty criteria.
The Chief Officer of Police or
Home Office (Immigration
Enforcement) has 14 days from
notification to object if they
believe that granting the licence
would undermine the prevention
of crime licensing objective. If
there is no objection then the
licence will be issued.
A personal licence is valid
indefinitely.
If a person is convicted of a
relevant or foreign offence or
required to pay an immigration
penalty during the application
period, the licensing authority
considering the application must
be told straightaway. Failure
to do this is a criminal offence
which carries a fine of no more
than £2,500 (Level 4).
Should the licensing authority
find out that a personal licence
holder has not informed them
of a conviction of a relevant or
foreign offence or immigration
penalty before or after the grant,
13

the personal licence may be
suspended for up to six months,
or it may be revoked. If the
relevant licensing authority is
considering whether to suspend
or revoke the licence, the
authority must give notice to
the personal licence holder.
A personal licence holder who
is charged with an offence must
tell the court dealing with the
offence that they hold a personal
licence no later than their first
appearance in court.
If a personal licence holder is
convicted of a relevant offence,
the court may order that the
licence is suspended (for up to
six months) or that it is forfeited
completely. Some examples of
relevant offences are:
i. An offence under either
the Licensing Act 1964 or
Licensing Act 2003

ii. Offences relating to driving
under the influence of
alcohol or drugs
iii. Firearms offences
iv. Sex offences
v. Theft
vi. Dealing in smuggled goods.
A relevant offence is any offence
listed in Schedule 4 of the
Licensing Act. Full details can be
found online at: legislation.gov.
uk/ukpga/2003/17/schedule/4
The term ‘foreign offence’ means
an offence (other than a relevant
offence) under the law of any
place outside England and Wales
that is equivalent to, although
not exactly the same as, a
relevant offence.
Some convictions have a period
of time after which they are
‘spent’, which means that under
law they are no longer counted
against the offender. However,
there are certain offences which
are never spent.

What you need to know
The Personal Licence
i. It is valid indefinitely
ii. An individual can hold only one
iii. It is valid in England and Wales
iv. To apply you must meet four criteria and submit five
things with your application
v. You must not have been convicted of any relevant offences
vi. You do not need a premises to hold a personal licence.

5. Premises Licence
Definition of ‘premises’
The term premises can be applied
to:
i. Any building, part of a building
or open space
ii. A moveable structure such as
a beer tent, a parked vehicle
such as a burger van or vessels
such as river boats.

What is a premises licence?
It authorises
premises
to be used
for one
or more
licensable
activities

It is granted
by the
licensing
authority
where the
premises is
situated

Following
the grant of
a premises
licence an
annual fee is
payable

An
application
fee set by
central
government
is payable

Validity of a premises licence
Once a premises licence has been
granted it will continue until the
business no longer exists or the
licence is surrendered, suspended
or revoked. The only exceptions
are if:

i. The licence was issued for
a specific time period
ii. The licence holder dies,
becomes mentally
incapacitated, ceases to
be entitled to work in the

ceasing to be entitled to work
in the UK or entering into
any form of insolvency, an
application for the transfer
of the licence to an eligible
person has to be made within
28 days of the date of the
licence lapsing. This transfer
is valid immediately so that
the business can continue
to operate, although the
application will go through
the usual approval process
and could be rejected by the
licensing authority.
Alternatively, an interim
authority notice can be served
on the licensing authority and
the police (also Home Office
(Immigration Enforcement)
if relevant), again within the
28-day period, which will also
allow the business to continue
operations in accordance with
the premises licence.
This notice is valid for a
maximum of three months.

Who can apply for a premises licence?

Mandatory conditions
on a premises licence
A premises licence which
authorises the sale of alcohol
will always include a number of
mandatory conditions:
Condition 1
There can be no sale of alcohol
at the premises unless there is a
Designated Premises Supervisor
(who must be a personal licence
holder) appointed for the
premises.
Condition 2
Every sale of alcohol on the
premises must be made or
authorised by a personal licence
holder. This means that anyone
who is not a personal licence
holder who is selling alcohol must
have been given permission to do
so by a personal licence holder.
It is recommended such
permission should be in writing
and records should be kept at
the premises.
Condition 3
No staff in licensed premises
should carry out, arrange or
participate in any irresponsible
promotions relating to the
premises.

An irresponsible promotion
means any one or more of
the following activities, or
substantially similar activities
that are carried out for the
purpose of encouraging the
sale or supply of alcohol for
consumption on the premises:
i. Games which require or
encourage people to drink
a quantity of alcohol within
a time limit (other than to
consume drinks already
purchased before the
premises closes), or to drink
as much alcohol as possible,
even without a time limit
ii. Unlimited or unspecified
amounts of alcohol being
given free or for a fixed
price to the public or a
group defined by a particular
characteristic, in a manner
which carries a significant
risk of undermining a
licensing objective (i.e.
all you can drink for £10;
women drink free)
iii. Free or discounted alcohol
(or anything else, such as
free concert tickets) as
a prize to encourage or
reward the purchase and
consumption of alcohol
over a 24-hour period, or
less, in a manner which
carries a significant risk of
undermining a licensing
objective
iv. Free or discounted alcohol
linked to a sporting event,
such as free drinks for 30

minutes after the game
if a certain team wins,
or greatly reduced prices
charged for measures of
spirits every time a try is
scored, in a manner which
carries a significant risk of
undermining a licensing
objective
v. Selling or supplying
alcohol in association with
promotional posters or flyers
which condone or glamorise
antisocial behaviour.
Condition 4
There is a ban on ‘dentist
chair’ games where alcohol

Relevant representations
Responsible authorities and any
other person have a right to
object to a new premises licence
application or to an application
for variation of an existing
licence (except for a change of
Designated Premises Supervisor),
as long as the representation
is not irrelevant, vexatious or
frivolous. Representations made
by a responsible authority cannot
be vexatious or frivolous. If no
agreement can be reached, there
will be a hearing in front of the
licensing authority. If any party is
unhappy about the decision made
at this hearing, they can make
an appeal to a magistrates’ court
within 21 days of the licensing
authority’s decision.

Hearings in the event
of disputes
At a hearing the licensing
authority can decide to:
i. Grant the licence on the
terms requested
ii. Grant the licence subject to
conditions believed to achieve
the licensing objectives
iii. Exclude certain activities from
the licence prior to granting it
iv. Refuse the appointment of
the specified Designated
Premises Supervisor
v. Reject the application.

Expedited/Summary Reviews
A police officer of the rank of
Superintendent or higher may
sign a certificate requesting a
Summary Review of a premises
licence that authorises the
sale of alcohol. The use of this
section of the Licensing Act 2003
is confined to cases of serious
crime or serious disorder.
The licensing authority must
make a determination within
48 hours of the receipt of
the certificate, deciding what
“interim” steps (if any) it
considers are necessary. The
licensing authority could order
that the Designated Premises
Supervisor be removed, the
imposition of conditions, the
exclusion of the sale of alcohol
by retail or for the premises
licence to be suspended. If
the licence is suspended, this
could effectively close the
premises, pending a full review
of the premises licence. The
review must take place within
28 days of the initial request
being received by the licensing
authority.
There is no requirement for the
premises licence holder, or their
representative, to be notified of
this initial consideration. There
could then be a situation where
the police have obtained the
suspension of a premises licence
without the premises licence
holder even being aware of it
until they have been served with
21

a notice of the suspension.
Premises licence holders may
be invited to attend an initial
interim steps hearing but in
any event, the premises licence
holder has the right to request
a hearing where they can make
representations against any
interim steps.
This representation hearing
must be heard within 48 hours
of the request being made by
the premises licence holder for
the hearing, and the licensing
authority must, at that hearing,
consider whether the interim
steps it initially imposed are
necessary for the promotion of
the licensing objectives, and
whether or not in light of that, it
is necessary to withdraw or not
modify the steps it took.
A full review of the premises
licence must then be held within
28 days of the receipt of the
request from the police, at which
the normal options on a review
are available to the licensing
authority.

Review of premises licences
A review of a premises licence
is to ensure that the licensing
objectives are being met and
that the community is protected
from crime and disorder; for
example if problems arise in
a premises, a review of the
licence may be instigated. An
application for a review can be
made either by a responsible
22

authority or by any other person
whether or not they live or work
in the vicinity. On determination
of a review, the authority may
take any of the following steps
which it considers appropriate to
promote the licensing objectives:
i. Modify the conditions
of the licence
ii. Exclude a licensable
activity from the licence
iii. Remove the Designated
Premises Supervisor
iv. Suspend the licence for
up to three months
v. Revoke the licence.
In some cases, the licensing
authority may decide that no
action needs to be taken as the
licensing objectives are being
met already. Modification or
exclusion may be permanent or
for a maximum period of
three months.

Duty to keep and produce
the premises licence
The premises licence holder
must ensure that the licence or
a certified copy of the licence
is kept at the premises. A
summary of the licence, or a
certified copy of the summary,
must be displayed prominently
at the premises. A police
constable or authorised person
may require the production
of the premises licence or the
certified copy for examination.

What you need to know
The Premises Licence
i. It authorises the premises to be used for one or more
licensable activities
ii. It is granted by the licensing authority where the
premises are located
iii. If an individual applies for a premises licence they must
be over 18 and entitled to work in the UK
iv. A premises licence application can be made by a single
person, a group of people or a company/business
v. Not complying with any conditions or employing
unlicensed security staff can attract a penalty of an
unlimited fine and/or up to six months in prison.

An operating schedule is part of a premises licence application.
The operating schedule will give an overview of how the premises
will run, and contain details such as:
a. The type of premises (e.g. supermarket, public house)
b. The licensable activities taking place (e.g. sale of alcohol by
retail)
c. The sort of facilities available to customers (e.g. dance areas,
beer garden)
d. The name and address of the Designated Premises Supervisor
and whether the alcohol is for consumption on the premises,
off the premises or both (for premises that sell alcohol only)
e. The times during which licensable activities will take place
f. Any other times the premises is open
g. Steps to promote the licensing objectives (see page 5).
Steps to promote the licensing objectives in the operating
schedule include details of how the four licensing objectives
will be promoted. On the opposite page are some examples of
measures that can be used to do this in a premises:

7. The Designated PremisesSupervisor

		

A Designated Premises Supervisor (DPS) is usually the person
named on the premises licence who has responsibility for day-to-day
management of the premises. The DPS does not have to be present
on the premises whenever they are open. Below are the main points
that you must know about the position:

The DPS
must
hold a
personal
licence
Police may object
to a DPS within
14 days under the
crime prevention
objective

The DPS is the
single point of
contact

There can only be
one nominated
DPS per premises

It is illegal
not to have
a DPS if you
sell alcohol

A
Designated
Premises
Supervisor
(DPS)
A nominated
DPS must
consent to
the position
in writing – a
copy of which
must be given
to the licensing
authority

A personal licence
holder who
authorises the sale
of alcohol does not
have to be the DPS

A premises
licence holder
can also
be the DPS

The DPS has
day-to-day
management
of the premises

A formal application by the premises licence holder is required
to change the DPS, along with the consent of the proposed
replacement. You should give serious consideration before accepting
a nomination as a DPS.
If the previous DPS has already left the premises, or they have had
their personal licence revoked or suspended, the application may
include a request that the variation takes immediate effect.
26

What you need to know
The Designated Premises Supervisor
i. They provide a single point of contact in licensed premises
ii. They are in day-to-day management of the premises
iii. It is illegal to sell alcohol without a DPS appointed for that
premises
iv. The DPS must hold a personal licence.

8. Temporary Event Notices
A Temporary Event Notice (TEN) is notification of an event which
will include a licensable activity, and which will often take place
at a venue not covered by a premises licence or a club premises
certificate which permits that activity. To hold a temporary event,
a notice must be given to the licensing authority, the police and
environmental health.
No authorisation is required, unless there is an objection. Under
the Licensing Act 2003, the police and environmental health can
object to a TEN within three working days if they believe it would
undermine any of the licensing objectives. Should an objection be
lodged to a standard TEN the licensing authority will determine the
TEN at a hearing. If an objection to a late TEN is lodged there is no
right to a hearing and the TEN may not go ahead.
There are a number of rules that apply to TENs:
There’s a minimum period of
24hrs between events at the
same premises when given by
the same user or associate

Only 15* TENs per year
can take place at the
same premises

Ensuring no more than
499 people attend at any
one time

i

Someone who does not hold a
personal licence is only allowed
to give up to five TENs per year,
where the number of late TENs
issued does not exceed two

The total duration of periods
covered by a notice in
respect of the same premises
can be no more than 21* days

Temporary
Event
Notices
(TENs)

An event can only
last for a maximum
of 168 hours

They must be given
by someone over
the age of 18

A personal licence holder can
give up to 50 TENs per year,
where the number of late TENs
issued does not exceed 10

15 and 21 extended to 20 and 26 respectively in 2022 and 2023.

*

28

There are two types of Temporary Event Notices: standard and late.
A standard Temporary Event Notice must be given no later than 10
working days before an event is due to take place. A late Temporary
Event Notice must be given no later than five working days before
an event is due to take place. This notification can be given either in
writing or electronically by the premises user.
Notice of a standard TEN must be given a minimum of 10
clear working days before the event is scheduled to begin,
and for a late TEN a minimum of five clear working days must
be given before the event is scheduled to begin.
These days are exclusive of the day of the event and the day of
receipt. So, for an event to be held on Saturday 18 September, a
standard TEN must be given by Friday 3 September. For a late TEN,
this notice can be given as late as Friday 10 September.
Premises which are to be used under a TEN must be described in
the notice. The notice of the TEN must be displayed throughout the
duration of the event.
Notice of cancellation of a temporary event has to be given to the
licensing authority no later than 24 hours before the time specified
for the start of the event.

What you need to know
The Premises Licence
i. Notice must be received by the licensing authority, the
police and environmental health
ii. A personal licence holder can issue 50 TENs per year,
where the number of late TENs issued does not exceed
10
iii. A non-personal licence holder can issue five TENs per year,
where the number of late TENs issued does not exceed
two
iv. An event under a TEN cannot run for longer than 168
hours.

9. Exemptions to the Sale and
Supply of Alcohol
Alcohol can be sold or supplied on or from the following premises
without a premises licence:
i. An airplane on a journey
ii. Ocean liner on a journey
iii. A train on a journey
iv. A ship/boat on an
international journey

v. A royal palace
vi. Premises occupied by the
military, e.g. army barracks,
naval base or air force base.

Where alcohol is sold on these premises there is no need for a
personal licence holder or a DPS.

Internet and mail‑order sales
Sales made over the internet, by telephone or by mail order do
NOT require a premises licence for the premises where the sale
takes place/from where the order is taken, provided that they are
separately located from the premises from which the alcohol is
dispatched (e.g. a call centre or order-processing office). However,
the premises from where the alcohol is dispatched does require a
premises licence and a Designated Premises Supervisor.

What you need to know
Exemptions to the Sale and Supply of Alcohol
i. Some premises are exempt from the requirement for a
premises licence
ii. Any orders which are not made in person (e.g. by phone,
mail or internet) only need a premises licence for the site
from where the alcohol is dispatched, not where the sale
takes place / the order is taken if separately located.

30

10. Prohibitions to the Sale ofAlcohol
Moving vehicles
It is against the law to sell
alcohol on a moving vehicle,
such as a coach. It must be
permanently or temporarily
parked with the relevant
authorisation to be able to
sell alcohol.
The offence could result in a
maximum penalty of:

an order to be appropriate to
promote the licensing objectives.
Any proposals to make an
EMRO must be advertised and
any representations must be
considered before the order
is made. No premises types
are exempt from EMROs,
except premises with overnight
accommodation offering either
mini-bar facilities or room
service.

Service areas and garages
Alcohol cannot, except under the
specific circumstances outlined
below, be sold at motorway
service areas or at premises
used primarily as a garage (sale
of fuel or maintenance of motor
vehicles).
The Licensing Act 2003 does
not currently apply to privately
owned motorway service
areas and such premises may
be granted premises licences
permitting the sale of alcohol.
Garages that also sell other
goods (such as groceries) may
be considered for a premises
licence for the sale of alcohol, if
they can prove that the premises
is not solely used as a garage
(normally shown by footfall or
turnover of non-alcohol related
products).

The offence could result in a
maximum penalty of:
Six months in prison and/or
an unlimited fine
If charged, a person may apply
the defence of ‘due diligence’,
which means that they have
to prove that under the
circumstances in which the
law was broken:
What happened was a mistake
or
They were reliant on the
actions of another person

licence application relates.
Premises under a provisional
statement application or a TEN
can also be assessed.
Police are the only authorised
personnel who can access and

search, at any time, premises
where they suspect that an
offence against licensing law has
been, is being or is about to be
committed. They do not require
a warrant.
An HM Revenue and Customs
officer is allowed to enter licensed
premises to remove goods ‘liable
to forfeiture’. An example could
include smuggled goods and
goods where the appropriate
duty has not been paid. If they
wanted to search premises at
night time, they would need to be
accompanied by a police officer.
It is an offence to obstruct any of
these officers.
If police officers need to enter

13. Powers to Close LicensedPremises
kVA senior police officer (inspector
or above), or the local authority,
can issue a Closure Notice to
individual premises if they
believe that there has been, or
likely to be, disorder near those
premises which is associated
with the use of the premises.
They can also issue a Closure
Notice on the grounds that the
use of a particular premises has
resulted, or is likely to result
in nuisance to members of the
public. The Closure Notice can
last for a maximum of 48 hours.
A Closure Notice may be given
in respect of premises operating
under a Premises Licence,
Club Premises Certificate or a
Temporary Event Notice.

alternatively, can adjourn the
hearing of an application for a
Closure Order for up to 14 days
to enable the occupier of the
premises to provide evidence
why a Closure Order should not
be made.

Unless a Closure Notice has been
cancelled, then the police or
local authority must apply to the
Magistrate’s Court for a Closure
Order, and the application must
be heard no later than 48 hours
after the service of the Closure
Notice.

An appeal can be brought
against the decision to make
or extend the Closure Order by
appealing to the Crown Court
within 21 days from the date of
the decision in the Magistrates’
Court.

A Magistrates’ Court may make a
Closure Order which can initially
last up to three months.
Alternatively, a Magistrates
Court can order that a Closure
Notice continues in force for
a further specified period of
not more than 48 hours or,
36

At any time before a Closure
Order expires, an application can
be made by the police or local
authority to extend the Closure
Order, it can be extended but
cannot last for a total of more
than six months.
At any time before the expiry of
the Closure Order, an application
can be made to have the Closure
Order discharged.

A person who breaches a
Closure Notice is liable to a
fine, or imprisonment for up to
three months or both, and any
person who breaches a Closure
Order is liable to a period of
imprisonment not exceeding 51
weeks, or a fine, or both.

Following the making of a
Closure Order, either by the
Magistrates’ Court or the Crown
Court, the licensing authority
must complete a review of the
Premises Licence within 28 days
of such order. If premises are
closed voluntarily without the
need for a Closure Order,
then a review will not
necessarily follow.

The Closure Order will only apply
to those premises within the
specified area with the benefit of
a Premises Licence or Temporary
Event Notice (TEN).
It is an offence to knowingly
allow premises subject to such a
Closure Order to remain open, or
allow them to remain open.
The offence is subject to a fine.

A senior police officer
(Superintendent or above) may
apply to a local magistrates’
court for an order requiring
all premises within a specified
area to close for a period up
to 24 hours where disorder is
occurring or expected to occur.

14. Protection of Children
It is a criminal offence for
anyone to sell alcohol to a
person who is under the
age of 18. There are no
exceptions to this.
All premises selling or supplying
alcohol are required to have an
age verification policy in place
which will require staff to check
the ID of anyone appearing to
be under the age of 18 (or any
such age specified in the policy)
before being served alcohol. It
is essential that if there is any
doubt about the customer’s age,
ID is asked for and checked
thoroughly. Schemes such as
Challenge 21/25 can operate in
conjunction with this policy.
Reliable proof-of-age
documents are:
i. A photo driving licence
ii. A passport
iii. A proof-of-age scheme
card that carries the
PASS hologram.
These forms of ID must have
the person’s name, date of
birth and photo on them, and
either a holographic mark or an
ultraviolet feature. PASS scheme
proof-of-age cards carry the
PASS hologram and are backed
by the Government and
Trading Standards.

38

When proof of age is produced,
it is advisable to take some or all
of the following steps:
a.

Compare the photograph
to the person’s face. In
particular look at the
cheekbones, the forehead,
nose, ears, and weight. Body
composition can change,
but inconsistencies can be a
telling sign that the ID does
not belong to the person
who is using it
b. Check that the eye colour
of the person matches that
in the photograph. Any
difference would suggest
that the ID did not belong to
the person using it
c. Check the date of birth to
ensure that the person is
over 18
d. Look to see if the ID is
current and valid. If a card,
licence or passport has
expired it is not valid ID
e. Ask for the person’s star
sign. Most people know
immediately whether they
are a Scorpio or a Leo. If
the person stumbles, it may

be a borrowed ID. Ask to
see a second or third form
of ID. Most people will carry
debit cards that should back
up the name on the ID that
they are presenting. Finally,
ask for a signature, and then
compare it to the signature
on the ID. Handwriting styles
do change sometimes, but
this can be an indicator that
the ID is suspicious
f. Check for tampering. Are
there raised edges around
the photo indicating that a
picture has been added on
top of the original?
g. Look out for fake ID. Are
any of the numbers or words
fuzzy as this might indicate
low quality printer ink? Any
misspelling on the document
should instantly make the
ID very suspicious. Does
the photo have red eye?
Do the holograms flake
off if you scratch them?
Are there bubbles under
the lamination? Swipe the
magnetic strip if the card has
one. Does the information on
it not read properly? Any of
these things can indicate a
poorly made fake.
Remember – there is a thriving
market for fake ID and many
of the fakes available are of
very high quality which makes
them difficult to spot. Always
take ID in your hands to check
it, take your time looking at it
and ask a colleague to support
your decision as to whether or

not it is genuine. For up-to-date
information on accepted ID
documents see the ‘Acceptable
Forms of ID’ section in the
Home Office’s document
‘False ID Guidance’ which can be
found online at:
gov.uk/government/
publications/false-id-guidance
When checking a
driving licence, follow the
five-point check below:
1. Look for the letters ‘DVLA’
2. Check that the surname and
numbers are raised
3. Ensure that the card has a
hologram
4. Check the driving licence
words (the word ‘permit’ is
an indicator of a fake)
5. Check the date of birth
(remember a person can
have a driving licence before
they are aged 18!).
If proof of age is not provided
or there are any doubts with the
proof-of-age document provided,
the sale of alcohol must be
refused.
It is illegal for under-18s to
consume alcohol in licensed
premises. However, there is
one exception. 16 and 17-yearolds are allowed to drink beer,
wine or cider with a table
meal, as long as the drink is
bought by an adult and they are
accompanied at the meal by an
adult.
39

On licensed premises there
may be conditions that refer to
the admission of children. This
information will be included in
the Premises Licence. The law
does state, however:
Unaccompanied children
under the age of 16 are not
allowed in licensed premises:
i. at a time when the premises
are open and exclusively or
primarily supplying alcohol
for consumption on the
premises
ii. between 00:00 and 05:00
when the premises are
open and supplying alcohol
for consumption on the
premises.
IT IS ILLEGAL
to sell alcohol to anyone
under the age of 18 or to

The licensed retail industry
can promote the responsible
retailing of alcohol by taking
all reasonable steps to stop
those under the age of 18 from
obtaining alcohol. It is a legal
requirement for all premises
licensed to sell alcohol to have
an age verification policy which
must be enforced by all staff at
the premises (see pages 18 and
48 for more information).

Within licensed premises, you
may encounter some of the
crimes associated with child
sexual exploitation. There are
a number of signs that may be
apparent, including:
i. Children and young people in
the company of older people
or antisocial groups
ii. Young people acting in an
inappropriate and sexualised
way with adults or older
people
iii. Children and young people
arriving and departing a
location with different adults
on the same day or even
over a period of time
iv. Children and young people
getting into and out of a
number of different cars

v. Groups of young people using
hotels or bed and breakfasts
with older people.
Children who are being sexually
exploited may show changes
in behaviour or start to look
different. The changes include:
i. Unexplained changes in
behaviour such as chaotic,
aggressive or sexual
behaviour
ii. Showing fear in, certain
company
iii. Having cuts and bruises
iv. Having expensive new items
such as phones or clothes
v. Having expensive new habits
such as smoking, drinking
or drugs.

What you need to know
Protection of Children

15. Definition and Nature of Alcohol
and How it Affects the Body
Alcohol means any spirits, wine, beer, cider or any other fermented,
distilled or spirituous liquor (in any form).
Drinking alcohol changes...

Your
physical state

Your
mental state

Your
emotional state

Therefore, alcohol is classed as a drug.
The strength of an alcoholic
drink depends on how much
alcohol there is in it. The amount
of alcohol is expressed as
percentage alcohol by volume,
or abv for short. This can be
shown on labels as alc.% vol or
% vol and this means that if a
beer, for example, is labelled as
4% vol. then 4% of its content
is alcohol.

i. Any drink which contains
more than 0.5% abv
is classed as alcohol
according to licensing law
ii. If a drink contains less
than 0.05% abv, it is said
to be alcohol-free
iii. A drink which contains no
more than 1.2% abv is
defined as ‘low alcohol’
iv. Any drink with over 1.2%
abv must have the abv
labelled on the packaging
v. The abv may vary from
drink to drink.

One unit of alcohol
=
8 grams or 10 millilitres of alcohol

44

Below is a rough guideline as to how much abv common drinks
typically contain:
Spirits

Wine

Beer

Cider

Consequences of excessive consumption of alcohol
Chronic drinking/alcoholism is where an individual consumes
excessive amounts of alcohol on a regular or daily basis, over a
long period of time. The UK Chief Medical Officers advise that men
and women are safest not drinking more than 14 units per week.
Pregnant women are advised to not drink alcohol at all.
The UK Chief Medical Officers suggest that if you want to reduce
your alcohol intake, a good way to do this is to have several
drink-free days. If you are drinking on a single occasion, it is
advised to limit the total amount of alcohol that may be consumed.
Drinking more slowly, drinking with food and alternating with water
are also recommended. If you do drink as much as 14 units per
week, it is best to spread this evenly over three days or more and
not “save up” your 14 units.

When alcohol is consumed it is absorbed into the bloodstream and
reaches all parts of the body. A person becomes drunk because
alcohol is a drug, the consumption of which has a temporary effect on
the workings of the brain. If it is consumed faster than the body can
remove it then the consumer becomes drunk.

45

Binge drinking is where an
individual regularly consumes
excessive alcohol in a single
session, usually with the
objective of getting drunk.
Blood alcohol concentration
(BAC) is the amount of alcohol
that is in the bloodstream at any
given time. The BAC starts to
fall, usually about 20 minutes
after the last drink, and it takes
approximately one hour to
remove one unit of alcohol from
the body.

In England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, a BAC of 80mg of
alcohol in 100ml of blood is the
level above which it is an offence
to drive. There is no simple
way of knowing how much an
individual can drink and stay
within the legal limits for driving.
Most of the alcohol is removed
by the liver, as the blood
circulates through it, but some
is also lost through the lungs
and urine. If a person drinks
more than moderate amounts
of alcohol it is likely to cause
damage to their health.

Food
The presence
of food in the
stomach slows
down the rate that
alcohol enters the
bloodstream

Gender
the same amount
of alcohol will
generally produce
a higher BAC in
women than men

Factors that
affect the
amount of
alcohol that
gets into the
bloodstream

Quantity
how many drinks a
person consumes
and how much
alcohol is in
each drink

46

Size
a small person has
less blood than a
large one, therefore
the same amount of
alcohol will produce
a higher BAC in a
small person than a
large person

16. Smoking, Drugs and Being
a Responsible Retailer
Alcohol retailers are often in the
limelight for irresponsible sales
of alcohol. This could be anything
from underage sales to serving
alcohol to people who are drunk.
The best way to be seen as a
responsible retailer is to promote
the licensing objectives wherever
possible. This can be done in
various ways, such as ensuring
that all staff are appropriately
trained, and using responsible
drinks promotions.
Encouraging people to drink
large amounts of alcohol is
definitely an irresponsible sale of
alcohol. You should make sure
that the alcohol you sell is not
aimed at children, and that you
do not encourage binge drinking
(by not offering irresponsible
promotions, e.g. 2 for 1 drinks
over a short period of time).
The Portman Group operates
guidelines on the naming,
packaging and merchandising of
alcoholic drinks. The codes that
are stated by the Portman Group
say that you should be able
to tell the difference between
alcoholic drinks and those that
do not contain alcohol.
It is against the law to sell
alcohol to a person who is drunk
or who appears to be drunk.
A person who is drunk must be
48

refused alcohol at all times. If
a member of staff asks a drunk
person to leave the premises and
they fail to do so, the person who
is drunk commits an offence.
Under the Licensing Act 2003
there are a number of other
offences that can be committed
by the premises licence holder,
the DPS for the premises, a
personal licence holder or anyone
else who works at the premises
and has the authority to prevent
the offence. These offences
include:
i. Allowing disorderly
conduct to occur on
licensed premises
ii. Exposing alcohol for
unauthorised sale
iii. Keeping smuggled goods.
The penalty on conviction of
selling alcohol to a person who is
or appears to be drunk, allowing
disorderly conduct on licensed

premises, keeping smuggled
goods or obtaining alcohol for a
person who is drunk is a fine not
exceeding Level 3 (£1,000). In
addition, a police officer who
witnesses the sale of alcohol to
a person who is or appears to be
drunk, can issue a fixed penalty
notice of £90.

Responsible retailing and the
mandatory conditions
There are a number of
mandatory conditions as
outlined on pages 18 to 20
which are aimed at encouraging
responsible retailing and these
apply to relevant premises
licences authorising the sale or
supply of alcohol. As a personal
licence holder it is important that
you are aware of these and that
you ensure that all staff working
in your premises are too.

Smoking on
licensed premises
In England, it is a requirement
by law to display at least one
easy-to-read ‘No Smoking’ sign
in premises, although a premises
may display more than one sign
if the owner/manager feels that
this is necessary.
In Wales, it is a requirement to
display at least one ‘No Smoking’
50

sign. There are no requirements
on the location of the signs.
The only requirement is that the
sign contains a legible graphic
representation of a burning
cigarette enclosed in a circle
which crosses the cigarette
symbol.
Failure to display such signs
can result in a fixed penalty
fine of £200 (reduced to £150 if
paid within 15 days from issue)
or, in case of prosecution and
conviction, a maximum fine
of £1,000.
If you are the person in control
of a premises and allow a person
to smoke, you can be fined up
to £2,500. Anyone smoking on
smoke-free premises may have
to pay a fixed penalty of £30
(rising to £50 if not paid within
15 days) or a fine of £200 in
the case of prosecution and
conviction.
Smoking shelters can be put
up outside, but it is important
to find out if you need planning
permission before doing so.
It is the responsibility of the
premises licence holder to
ensure that the licensing
objectives are upheld and that
no public nuisance is created by
those using any smoking shelter
provided. A smoking shelter
must be no more than 50%
enclosed.

Drugs on licensed premises
Misuse of drugs is an incident
which could occur on any type of
premises. It is against the law to
turn a ‘blind eye’ to drug activity.
If this activity is allowed to
occur, the result may be a
review of the premises licence
and/or the forfeiture of the
DPS’s personal licence.
It is important that premises
licence holders implement a
zero-tolerance policy in relation
to illegal drug activity. Staff
should be aware of this policy
and be trained to spot any

possible signs of drug taking or
drug dealing so that they can
report any suspicions that they
may have. If a premises licence
holder or DPS believes that their
premises is being used for drugrelated activity, they are strongly
advised to seek advice from
the police.
Under the Anti-Social Behaviour,
Crime and Policing Act 2014, the
police have the power to close
down any licensed premises
where dealing in or production
of Class A drugs (such as heroin,
cocaine and ecstasy) is taking
place or where there is serious
nuisance or disorder.

What you need to know
Being a responsible retailer
i. It is important to not let anyone smoke in your premises,
as they can be fined and so can you
ii. You should not offer irresponsible alcohol promotions.

2. Right to work/immigration status

pl
e

A personal licence may not be issued to an individual or an individual in a partnership
which is not a limited liability partnership who is resident in the UK who:
• does not have the right to live and work in the UK; or
• is subject to a condition preventing him or her from doing work relating to the
carrying on of a licensable activity.
Any personal licence issued in respect of an application made on or after 6 April
2017 will become invalid if the holder ceases to be entitled to work in the UK.

Applicants must demonstrate that they have the right to work in the UK and are not
subject to a condition preventing them from doing work relating to the carrying on of a
licensable activity.
They do this in one of two ways:

1) by providing with this application copies or scanned copies of the documents

Sa
m

which an applicant has provided, to demonstrate their entitlement to work in
the UK (which do not need to be certified) as per information published on
gov.uk and in guidance.
2) by providing their ‘share code’ to enable the licensing authority to carry out a
check using the Home Office online right to work checking service (see below).

Home Office online right to work checking service.
As an alternative to providing a copy of original documents, applicants may
demonstrate their right to work by allowing the licensing authority to carry out a check
with the Home Office online right to work checking service.
To demonstrate their right to work via the Home Office online right to work checking
service, applicants should include in this application their share code, provided to
them upon accessing the service at https://www.gov.uk/prove-right-to-work) which,
along with the applicant’s date of birth, will allow the licensing authority to carry out
the check.
In order to establish the applicant’s right to work, the check will need to indicate that
the applicant is allowed to work in the United Kingdom and is not subject to a
condition preventing them from doing work relating to the carrying on of a licensable
activity.
An online check will not be possible in all circumstances because not all applicants
will have an immigration status that can be shared digitally. The Home Office online
right to work checking service sets out what information and/or documentation
applicants will need in order to access the service. Applicants who are unable to
obtain a share code from the service should submit copies of documents as set out
above.
Your right to work will be checked as part of your licensing application and this could
involve us checking your immigration status with the Home Office. We may otherwise
share information with the Home Office. Your licence application will not be
determined until you have complied with this guidance.

Activity 7
Make the following paragraph correct by highlighting or underlining
the appropriate set of bold words.
Where a premises licence authorises the sale of alcohol as one
of the licensable activities a nominated person, the Designated
Premises Supervisor/Designated Personal Superior, provides
a rundown of all financial spending/single point of contact.
This means that the person who is responsible for the day-to-day
management of the premises will be easily identifiable/always
on the premises.
A condition of a person being the DPS is that they must hold the
premises licence/a personal licence. There must be only one/
at least two DPS per premises.
If it becomes necessary to change the DPS, the premises licence
holder/ premises owner must make a formal application to vary
the premises licence. The consent of the new DPS must accompany
the application.
The police can object to the change of a DPS within 14/21 days if
they believe that granting the application would undermine the
crime prevention objective/cause an inconvenience to local
businesses.
If the DPS has left the premises immediately, the application can
include a variation/transfer which will be given immediate effect.
This is essential as it is illegal for alcohol to be sold from premises
that do not have a current DPS.
