police constable or authorised
officer of the licensing authority

of a conviction for a relevant or
foreign offence or immigration
penalty, and returning
their licence

Notifying the court that they
hold a personal licence
if charged with a
relevant offence

Producing their licence to the licensing authority
if they are notified of a conviction by a court
A personal licence holder also commits an offence if, while they are
working, they fail to produce their personal licence if asked to do so
by a police constable or other authorised officer.
If a personal licence holder fails to produce their personal licence for
updating within 14 days, or fails to carry out any of their legal duties
then they commit an offence and can be subject to a fine of up to
Â£500 (Level 2).
If a personal licence holder wishes to surrender their personal
licence they must return the licence to the licensing authority which
issued the original licence, together with a signed letter, stating that
they wish to surrender the licence.
