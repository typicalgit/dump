Mandatory conditions
on a premises licence
A premises licence which
authorises the sale of alcohol
will always include a number of
mandatory conditions:

at the premises unless there is a
Designated Premises Supervisor
(who must be a personal licence
holder) appointed for the
premises.
Condition 2
Every sale of alcohol on the
premises must be made or
authorised by a personal licence
holder. This means that anyone
who is not a personal licence

permission should be in writing
and records should be kept at
the premises.

substantially similar activities
that are carried out for the
purpose of encouraging the
sale or supply of alcohol for
consumption on the premises:
i. Games which require or
encourage people to drink
a quantity of alcohol within
a time limit (other than to
consume drinks already
purchased before the
premises closes), or to drink
as much alcohol as possible,
even without a time limit
ii. Unlimited or unspecified
amounts of alcohol being

iii. Free or discounted alcohol
(or anything else, such as
free concert tickets) as

less, in a manner which
carries a significant risk of
undermining a licensing
objective
iv. Free or discounted alcohol
linked to a sporting event,
such as free drinks for 30

minutes after the game

or greatly reduced prices
charged for measures of
spirits every time a try is

carries a significant risk of
undermining a licensing
objective

alcohol in association with
promotional posters or flyers
which condone or glamorise
antisocial behaviour.

chair’ games where alcohol
is dispensed directly into the
mouth of a customer.

Relevant representations
Responsible authorities and any
other person have a right to
object to a new premises licence
application or to an application
for variation of an existing
licence (except for a change of
Designated Premises Supervisor),
as long as the representation
is not irrelevant, vexatious or
frivolous. Representations made
by a responsible authority cannot
be vexatious or frivolous. If no
agreement can be reached, there
will be a hearing in front of the
licensing authority. If any party is
unhappy about the decision made
at this hearing, they can make
an appeal to a magistrates’ court
within 21 days of the licensing
authority’s decision.

Hearings in the event
of disputes
At a hearing the licensing
authority can decide to:
i. Grant the licence on the
terms requested
ii. Grant the licence subject to
conditions believed to achieve
the licensing objectives
iii. Exclude certain activities from
the licence prior to granting it
iv. Refuse the appointment of
the specified Designated
Premises Supervisor
v. Reject the application.

Expedited/Summary Reviews
A police officer of the rank of
Superintendent or higher may
sign a certificate requesting a
Summary Review of a premises
licence that authorises the
sale of alcohol. The use of this
section of the Licensing Act 2003
is confined to cases of serious
crime or serious disorder.
The licensing authority must
make a determination within
48 hours of the receipt of
the certificate, deciding what
“interim” steps (if any) it
considers are necessary. The
licensing authority could order
that the Designated Premises
Supervisor be removed, the
imposition of conditions, the
exclusion of the sale of alcohol
by retail or for the premises
licence to be suspended. If
the licence is suspended, this
could effectively close the
premises, pending a full review
of the premises licence. The
review must take place within
28 days of the initial request
being received by the licensing
authority.
There is no requirement for the
premises licence holder, or their
representative, to be notified of
this initial consideration. There
could then be a situation where
the police have obtained the
suspension of a premises licence
without the premises licence
holder even being aware of it
until they have been served with
21

a notice of the suspension.
Premises licence holders may
be invited to attend an initial
interim steps hearing but in
any event, the premises licence
holder has the right to request
a hearing where they can make
representations against any
interim steps.
This representation hearing
must be heard within 48 hours
of the request being made by
the premises licence holder for
the hearing, and the licensing
authority must, at that hearing,
consider whether the interim
steps it initially imposed are
necessary for the promotion of
the licensing objectives, and
whether or not in light of that, it
is necessary to withdraw or not
modify the steps it took.
A full review of the premises
licence must then be held within
28 days of the receipt of the
request from the police, at which
the normal options on a review
are available to the licensing
authority.

Review of premises licences
A review of a premises licence
is to ensure that the licensing
objectives are being met and
that the community is protected
from crime and disorder; for
example if problems arise in
a premises, a review of the
licence may be instigated. An
application for a review can be
made either by a responsible
22

authority or by any other person
whether or not they live or work
in the vicinity. On determination
of a review, the authority may
take any of the following steps
which it considers appropriate to
promote the licensing objectives:
i. Modify the conditions
of the licence
ii. Exclude a licensable
activity from the licence
iii. Remove the Designated
Premises Supervisor
iv. Suspend the licence for
up to three months
v. Revoke the licence.
In some cases, the licensing
authority may decide that no
action needs to be taken as the
licensing objectives are being
met already. Modification or
exclusion may be permanent or
for a maximum period of
three months.

Duty to keep and produce
the premises licence
The premises licence holder
must ensure that the licence or
a certified copy of the licence
is kept at the premises. A
summary of the licence, or a
certified copy of the summary,
must be displayed prominently
at the premises. A police
constable or authorised person
may require the production
of the premises licence or the
certified copy for examination.
