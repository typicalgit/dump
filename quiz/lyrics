LYRICS
I believe in miracles
Another turning point a fork stuck in the road
I remember, I remember. I remember when
I've got two tickets to see iron maiden baby
You spin my head right round right round
Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
I'm sailing away
All of a sudden there shined a shiny daemon in the middle of the road
