15. Definition and Nature of Alcohol
and How it Affects the Body
Alcohol means any spirits, wine, beer, cider or any other fermented,
distilled or spirituous liquor (in any form).
Drinking alcohol changes...

Your
physical state

Your
mental state

Your
emotional state

Therefore, alcohol is classed as a drug.
The strength of an alcoholic
drink depends on how much
alcohol there is in it. The amount
of alcohol is expressed as
percentage alcohol by volume,
or abv for short. This can be
shown on labels as alc.% vol or
% vol and this means that if a
beer, for example, is labelled as
4% vol. then 4% of its content
is alcohol.

i. Any drink which contains
more than 0.5% abv
is classed as alcohol
according to licensing law
ii. If a drink contains less
than 0.05% abv, it is said
to be alcohol-free
iii. A drink which contains no
more than 1.2% abv is
defined as ‘low alcohol’
iv. Any drink with over 1.2%
abv must have the abv
labelled on the packaging
v. The abv may vary from
drink to drink.

One unit of alcohol
=
8 grams or 10 millilitres of alcohol

typically contain:

8-16%

3-9%

3-8.5%

Consequences of excessive consumption of alcohol
Chronic drinking/alcoholism is where an individual consumes
excessive amounts of alcohol on a regular or daily basis, over a
long period of time. The UK Chief Medical Officers advise that men
and women are safest not drinking more than 14 units per week.
Pregnant women are advised to not drink alcohol at all.
The UK Chief Medical Officers suggest that if you want to reduce
your alcohol intake, a good way to do this is to have several
drink-free days. If you are drinking on a single occasion, it is
advised to limit the total amount of alcohol that may be consumed.
Drinking more slowly, drinking with food and alternating with water
are also recommended. If you do drink as much as 14 units per
week, it is best to spread this evenly over three days or more and
not “save up” your 14 units.

When alcohol is consumed it is absorbed into the bloodstream and
reaches all parts of the body. A person becomes drunk because
alcohol is a drug, the consumption of which has a temporary effect on
the workings of the brain. If it is consumed faster than the body can
remove it then the consumer becomes drunk.

Binge drinking is where an
individual regularly consumes
excessive alcohol in a single
session, usually with the
objective of getting drunk.
Blood alcohol concentration
(BAC) is the amount of alcohol
that is in the bloodstream at any
given time. The BAC starts to
fall, usually about 20 minutes
after the last drink, and it takes
approximately one hour to
remove one unit of alcohol from
the body.

In England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, a BAC of 80mg of
alcohol in 100ml of blood is the
level above which it is an offence
to drive. There is no simple
way of knowing how much an
individual can drink and stay
within the legal limits for driving.
Most of the alcohol is removed
by the liver, as the blood
circulates through it, but some
is also lost through the lungs
and urine. If a person drinks
more than moderate amounts
of alcohol it is likely to cause
damage to their health.

Food
The presence
of food in the
stomach slows
down the rate that
alcohol enters the
bloodstream

Gender
the same amount
of alcohol will
generally produce
a higher BAC in
women than men

Factors that
affect the
amount of
alcohol that
gets into the
bloodstream

Quantity
how many drinks a
person consumes
and how much
alcohol is in
each drink

46

Size
a small person has
less blood than a
large one, therefore
the same amount of
alcohol will produce
a higher BAC in a
small person than a
large person
