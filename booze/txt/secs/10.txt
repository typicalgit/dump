10. Prohibitions to the Sale ofAlcohol
Moving vehicles
It is against the law to sell
alcohol on a moving vehicle,
such as a coach. It must be
permanently or temporarily
parked with the relevant
authorisation to be able to
sell alcohol.
The offence could result in a
maximum penalty of:
Three months in prison and/
or an unlimited fine.

Power to prohibit the sale
of alcohol on trains
If there is the possibility of
disorder, a magistrates’ court
may, on application by a senior
police officer (of the rank of
inspector or above), make an
order banning the sale of alcohol
during a specific time on trains
travelling within the court’s area.

Early morning alcohol
restriction orders
A licensing authority may
choose to make an Early
Morning Alcohol Restriction
Order (EMRO) to restrict sales
of alcohol in either all or part of
its area either for a limited or
unlimited period between 00:00
and 06:00 if it believes such

an order to be appropriate to
promote the licensing objectives.
Any proposals to make an
EMRO must be advertised and
any representations must be
considered before the order
is made. No premises types
are exempt from EMROs,
except premises with overnight
accommodation offering either
mini-bar facilities or room
service.

Service areas and garages
Alcohol cannot, except under the
specific circumstances outlined
below, be sold at motorway
service areas or at premises
used primarily as a garage (sale
of fuel or maintenance of motor
vehicles).
The Licensing Act 2003 does
not currently apply to privately
owned motorway service
areas and such premises may
be granted premises licences
permitting the sale of alcohol.
Garages that also sell other
goods (such as groceries) may
be considered for a premises
licence for the sale of alcohol, if
they can prove that the premises
is not solely used as a garage
(normally shown by footfall or
turnover of non-alcohol related
products).
