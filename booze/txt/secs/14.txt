14. Protection of Children
It is a criminal offence for
anyone to sell alcohol to a
person who is under the
age of 18. There are no
exceptions to this.
All premises selling or supplying
alcohol are required to have an
age verification policy in place
which will require staff to check
the ID of anyone appearing to
be under the age of 18 (or any
such age specified in the policy)
before being served alcohol. It
is essential that if there is any
doubt about the customer’s age,
ID is asked for and checked
thoroughly. Schemes such as
Challenge 21/25 can operate in
conjunction with this policy.
Reliable proof-of-age
documents are:
i. A photo driving licence
ii. A passport
iii. A proof-of-age scheme
card that carries the
PASS hologram.
These forms of ID must have
the person’s name, date of
birth and photo on them, and
either a holographic mark or an
ultraviolet feature. PASS scheme
proof-of-age cards carry the
PASS hologram and are backed
by the Government and
Trading Standards.

When proof of age is produced,
it is advisable to take some or all
of the following steps:
a.

Compare the photograph
to the person’s face. In
particular look at the
cheekbones, the forehead,
nose, ears, and weight. Body
composition can change,
but inconsistencies can be a
telling sign that the ID does
not belong to the person
who is using it
b. Check that the eye colour
of the person matches that
in the photograph. Any
difference would suggest
that the ID did not belong to
the person using it
c. Check the date of birth to
ensure that the person is
over 18
d. Look to see if the ID is
current and valid. If a card,
licence or passport has
expired it is not valid ID
e. Ask for the person’s star
sign. Most people know
immediately whether they
are a Scorpio or a Leo. If
the person stumbles, it may

be a borrowed ID. Ask to
see a second or third form
of ID. Most people will carry
debit cards that should back
up the name on the ID that
they are presenting. Finally,
ask for a signature, and then
compare it to the signature
on the ID. Handwriting styles
do change sometimes, but
this can be an indicator that
the ID is suspicious
f. Check for tampering. Are
there raised edges around
the photo indicating that a
picture has been added on
top of the original?
g. Look out for fake ID. Are
any of the numbers or words
fuzzy as this might indicate
low quality printer ink? Any
misspelling on the document
should instantly make the
ID very suspicious. Does
the photo have red eye?
Do the holograms flake
off if you scratch them?
Are there bubbles under
the lamination? Swipe the
magnetic strip if the card has
one. Does the information on
it not read properly? Any of
these things can indicate a
poorly made fake.
Remember – there is a thriving
market for fake ID and many
of the fakes available are of
very high quality which makes
them difficult to spot. Always
take ID in your hands to check
it, take your time looking at it
and ask a colleague to support
your decision as to whether or

not it is genuine. For up-to-date
information on accepted ID
documents see the ‘Acceptable
Forms of ID’ section in the
Home Office’s document
‘False ID Guidance’ which can be
found online at:
gov.uk/government/
publications/false-id-guidance
When checking a
driving licence, follow the
five-point check below:
1. Look for the letters ‘DVLA’
2. Check that the surname and
numbers are raised
3. Ensure that the card has a
hologram
4. Check the driving licence
words (the word ‘permit’ is
an indicator of a fake)
5. Check the date of birth
(remember a person can
have a driving licence before
they are aged 18!).
If proof of age is not provided
or there are any doubts with the
proof-of-age document provided,
the sale of alcohol must be
refused.
It is illegal for under-18s to
consume alcohol in licensed
premises. However, there is
one exception. 16 and 17-yearolds are allowed to drink beer,
wine or cider with a table
meal, as long as the drink is
bought by an adult and they are
accompanied at the meal by an
adult.
39

On licensed premises there
may be conditions that refer to
the admission of children. This
information will be included in
the Premises Licence. The law
does state, however:
Unaccompanied children
under the age of 16 are not
allowed in licensed premises:
i. at a time when the premises
are open and exclusively or
primarily supplying alcohol
for consumption on the
premises
ii. between 00:00 and 05:00
when the premises are
open and supplying alcohol
for consumption on the
premises.
IT IS ILLEGAL
to sell alcohol to anyone
under the age of 18 or to
knowingly allow the sale of
alcohol to anyone under the
age of 18

for anyone under the age
of 18 to buy or attempt to
buy alcohol

for anyone aged 18 or over
to buy or attempt to buy
alcohol for someone under
the age of 18
40

If on two or more separate
occasions in a period of three
consecutive months, alcohol
is unlawfully sold to a minor
on the premises, an unlimited
fine may be imposed on the
premises licence holder upon
conviction and alcohol sales
may be suspended for up to
three months. In addition, the
person selling the alcohol may
also be fined, receive a formal
caution or be prosecuted.
Where a premises licence
holder sells alcohol to a minor
on two or more separate
occasions in a period of three
consecutive months, voluntary
closure can be agreed with
either the police or Trading
Standards for a period of
at least 48 hours but not
more than 336 hours as an
alternative to prosecution.
It is illegal for a member
of staff to knowingly allow
children under the age of 18
to consume alcohol (except as
stated above).
It is an offence for someone
working on licensed premises
to knowingly deliver alcohol
sold on the premises to
someone under the age of
18. It is also an offence to
knowingly send a person under
the age of 18 to obtain alcohol
that is sold for consumption on
or off the premises.

It is illegal to allow a person
under the age of 18 to sell
alcohol unless each and every
sale is specifically authorised
by a responsible person, or the
alcohol is sold or supplied with a
table meal in a restaurant area.
It is also illegal to sell:
i. Cigarettes or other tobacco
products to a person under
the age of 18
ii. Solvent-based products to
a person under the age of
18 if there is a belief that
the product will be used for
inhalation or intoxication
iii. Gas lighter refills to a
person under the age of 18
iv. Fireworks to a person under
the age of 18 (or under the
age of 16 in the case of
party poppers)
v. Knives to a person under
the age of 18.

Under the Gambling Act
2005, those running licensed
premises need to be
aware that:
It is illegal for anyone under the
age of 18 to use cash gaming
machines with a maximum prize
value more than £50 and a
notice forbidding the use of such
machines by under-18s must be
clearly displayed. The machines
must also be supervised to stop
any underage play.
It is illegal for National
Lottery producats (including
scratchcards) to be sold to
anyone under the age of 18.
Test purchasing is where police
and Weights and Measures
inspectors are empowered to
send persons under the age of
18 to attempt to buy alcohol.
No offence is committed by
the underage person in
these circumstances.

The licensed retail industry
can promote the responsible
retailing of alcohol by taking
all reasonable steps to stop
those under the age of 18 from
obtaining alcohol. It is a legal
requirement for all premises
licensed to sell alcohol to have
an age verification policy which
must be enforced by all staff at
the premises (see pages 18 and
48 for more information).

Within licensed premises, you
may encounter some of the
crimes associated with child
sexual exploitation. There are
a number of signs that may be
apparent, including:
i. Children and young people in
the company of older people
or antisocial groups
ii. Young people acting in an
inappropriate and sexualised
way with adults or older
people
iii. Children and young people
arriving and departing a
location with different adults
on the same day or even
over a period of time
iv. Children and young people
getting into and out of a
number of different cars

v. Groups of young people using
hotels or bed and breakfasts
with older people.
Children who are being sexually
exploited may show changes
in behaviour or start to look
different. The changes include:
i. Unexplained changes in
behaviour such as chaotic,
aggressive or sexual
behaviour
ii. Showing fear in, certain
company
iii. Having cuts and bruises
