1. The Licensing Act 2003
The history of licensing
The introduction of licensing laws
dates back to the Gin Act 1751,
which was introduced due to the
‘gin craze’ in Britain, when the
production of gin increased to
six times that of beer. Under the
Gin Act, gin makers were forced
to sell to licensed premises and
control of these premises by the
local magistrates was introduced.
In the 19th century, licensing
hours were gradually imposed,
with additional restrictions on
opening hours being introduced
during World War I. However,
over the years these restrictions
were relaxed.

The Licensing Act 2003
The Licensing Act 2003, which
came into force in November
2005, replaced all previous
licensing laws and moved the
responsibility for licensing away
from the local magistrates
to the local authorities. A
single integrated system was
introduced throughout England
and Wales to regulate the sale
and supply of alcohol, the
provision of entertainment to
the public and the provision
of late-night refreshment. The
act also includes the statutory
requirement that all retail sales
of alcohol must be made, or
4

authorised by, a personal licence
holder. In addition, premises
which are licensed for the sale of
alcohol must have a Designated
Premises Supervisor (DPS)
appointed. This DPS must be a
personal licence holder.

Licensing objectives
There are four licensing
objectives under the Licensing
Act 2003. You must know what
they are as each objective
is important and forms the
structure of the licensing law.
To demonstrate support for
the licensing objectives it is
advisable that staff are properly
trained and qualified in
licensing law.
You must promote the licensing
objectives at all times in
your business.

The four licensing
objectives are:
1. Prevention
of crime
and disorder

2. Public
Safety

3. Prevention of
public nuisance

4. Protection
of children
from harm

Licensable activities
There are four licensing activities under the Licensing Act 2003:
1. Sale of alcohol by retail
2. Supply of alcohol on club premises
3. Provision of regulated entertainment
4. Late-night refreshment.
The sale of alcohol by retail is the only licensable activity that
requires a personal licence holder (PLH) and Designated Premises
Supervisor (DPS).

Sale of alcohol by retail
This is the sale of alcohol to any
person except in the following
situations:
i. To a trader for the purpose
of their trade. For example
the sale of wine by a
distributor to a supermarket
is not classed as a sale of
alcohol by retail
ii. To a members’ club
iii. To a personal or premises
licence holder for the
purposes of making sales
according to the terms of a
premises licence

iv. To a premises user who has
a Temporary Event Notice
for the purpose of making
sales authorised by that
notice.
For the sale of alcohol by retail
a premises must have:
At least one personal
licence holder (PLH)
A named Designated
Premises Supervisor (DPS)
(this person must be a PLH)
A premises licence
5

It is a mandatory condition
that all sales of alcohol are
authorised by a personal
licence holder.
In some premises there
may only be one personal
licence holder who is also the
Designated Premises Supervisor.
In others there may be multiple
personal licence holders;
however, there will still only be
one DPS.

Supply of alcohol on
club premises

Provision of regulated
entertainment
Regulated entertainment consists
of providing certain entertainment
for an audience or spectators. The
following activities are examples
of regulated entertainment:
a.

b.

There are a wide variety of clubs
that exist which include:
i. Political-based members’
clubs
ii. Working men’s clubs
iii. Sports and social clubs.
Technically no sale to a member
actually takes place on club
premises because the members
of the club own the alcohol, and
for this reason such transactions
are referred to as ‘supply of
alcohol’.

c.

d.

To supply alcohol on a club
premises, the premises must
have a club premises certificate.
However, no personal licence
holder, premises licence or DPS
is required.

Even if no charge has been
made, regulated entertainment
will still be classed as a
licensable activity. However,
there are some activities that
are not classed as regulated
entertainment, including:
a.

Games such as pool, darts
etc. (unless the game is
staged for spectators, for
example a celebrity
darts match)
b. Morris dancing
c. Music used in a religious
ceremony
d. Background music.

or unamplified, or the playing
of recorded music, will not

or club premises certificate
in place permitting the
sale or supply of alcohol
for consumption on the
premises,
b. The premises are open for

c.

The music is being
performed between 08:00
and 23:00, and
d. In the case of amplified live
music, the audience consists
of no more than 500 people.

Live music will also not
be classed as regulated
entertainment if:
a. The live music is unamplified
and is performed between
08:00 and 23:00 regardless
of where the music is
performed or the size of
the audience
b. The live music is performed
in a workplace (as defined
by the Workplace (Health,
Safety and Welfare)
Regulations 1992) which
is not licensed under the
Licensing Act 2003 (with the
exception for the provision of
late-night refreshment) and
the performance takes place
between the hours of 08:00
and 23:00 to an audience of
no more than 500 people.
If different activities with
different audience thresholds
are taking place at the same
premises at the same time,
organisers must ensure that the
audience for each activity does
not exceed the relevant limits
unless the correct licence is
in place.
In order to provide regulated
entertainment, a premises
must have a premises licence
7

which authorises such activity.
TheMusicLicence from PPL PRS
Limited (previously Phonographic
Performance Limited and
Performing Right Society) may
also be required and if alcohol
is to be sold there must also
be at least one personal licence
holder and a named Designated
Premises Supervisor.

Provision of
late‑night refreshment
The provision of late-night
refreshment is the supply of hot
food or hot drink to members of
the public between the hours of
23:00 and 05:00; this applies
for consumption both on and off
the premises. Examples are:
i. Pubs and restaurants
ii. Burger and kebab vans

Types of licences
There are two types of licence
under the Licensing Act 2003:
A Personal Licence:
allows a person to sell, or
authorise the sale of, alcohol. Any
sale, or authorisation of sale, must
be in accordance with the terms
of the premises licence for the
premises where the sale is made.
A Premises Licence:
authorises a premises to be
used for one or more of the
licensable activities.

Licensing authorities
Alcohol and entertainment
licensing in each area of England
and Wales is the responsibility of
the local licensing authority, which
deals with all licensing matters.

A licensing authority can be any
one of the following bodies:

Licensing hearings
and appeals

a. A district council in England
b. A county council in England,
where there are no separate
districts within the county
c. A county council or county
borough in Wales
d. The council of each London
borough
e. The common council of the
city of London
f. The council of the Isles of
Scilly.

Licensing hearings may take
place if there have been
objections or issues determining
applications:

Each licensing authority must
publish a Statement of Licensing
Policy, setting out how that
authority intends to promote the
licensing objectives. A licensing
committee considers the licensing
policies in relation to deciding
whether to grant a licence or not.
Each licensing authority appoints
a licensing committee consisting
of at least 10, but no more than
15, elected council members. A
licensing officer may deal with
some of the committee’s tasks,
such as dealing with premises and
personal licence applications.
Every licensing authority must
keep a register that contains:
i. A record of every premises
licence, personal licence and
club premises certificate
issued
ii. A record of every Temporary
Event Notice (TEN) received
iii. A record of all notices and
applications.

i. To grant, transfer, review or
vary a premises licence
ii. To grant, review or vary a
club premises certificate
iii. To grant a personal licence.
A hearing may also be held if an
objection is made in relation to
the issue of a Temporary Event
Notice (TEN).
Following a hearing to consider
a personal licence application
the licence will be refused if
the licensing authority agrees
with the objection notice issued
by the Chief Officer of Police
or Home Office (Immigration
Enforcement) on the grounds
that it would undermine the
crime prevention licensing
objective.
If any party remains unsatisfied
by the decision made at a
hearing, they can challenge the
authority’s decision through an
appeal to a magistrates’ court.
Appeals must be made within
21 days of the applicant being
notified of the decision by the
licensing authority.

Partnership working
Partnerships are vital to making sure that the licensing objectives
are being met and promoted. A premises licence holder can show
support for the licensing objectives by working in partnership with
the authorities and other organisations.
There are many partnerships that work together to ensure the
smooth running and ongoing operations of the licensing process.
