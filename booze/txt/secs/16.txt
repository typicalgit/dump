16. Smoking, Drugs and Being
a Responsible Retailer
Alcohol retailers are often in the
limelight for irresponsible sales
of alcohol. This could be anything
from underage sales to serving
alcohol to people who are drunk.
The best way to be seen as a
responsible retailer is to promote
the licensing objectives wherever
possible. This can be done in
various ways, such as ensuring
that all staff are appropriately
trained, and using responsible
drinks promotions.
Encouraging people to drink
large amounts of alcohol is
definitely an irresponsible sale of
alcohol. You should make sure
that the alcohol you sell is not
aimed at children, and that you
do not encourage binge drinking
(by not offering irresponsible
promotions, e.g. 2 for 1 drinks
over a short period of time).
The Portman Group operates
guidelines on the naming,
packaging and merchandising of
alcoholic drinks. The codes that
are stated by the Portman Group
say that you should be able
to tell the difference between
alcoholic drinks and those that
do not contain alcohol.
It is against the law to sell
alcohol to a person who is drunk
or who appears to be drunk.
A person who is drunk must be

refused alcohol at all times. If
a member of staff asks a drunk
person to leave the premises and
they fail to do so, the person who
is drunk commits an offence.
Under the Licensing Act 2003
there are a number of other
offences that can be committed
by the premises licence holder,
the DPS for the premises, a
personal licence holder or anyone
else who works at the premises
and has the authority to prevent
the offence. These offences
include:
i. Allowing disorderly
conduct to occur on
licensed premises
ii. Exposing alcohol for
unauthorised sale
iii. Keeping smuggled goods.
The penalty on conviction of
selling alcohol to a person who is
or appears to be drunk, allowing
disorderly conduct on licensed

premises, keeping smuggled
goods or obtaining alcohol for a
person who is drunk is a fine not
exceeding Level 3 (£1,000). In
addition, a police officer who
witnesses the sale of alcohol to
a person who is or appears to be
drunk, can issue a fixed penalty
notice of £90.

Responsible retailing and the
mandatory conditions
There are a number of
mandatory conditions as
outlined on pages 18 to 20
which are aimed at encouraging
responsible retailing and these
apply to relevant premises
licences authorising the sale or
supply of alcohol. As a personal
licence holder it is important that
you are aware of these and that
you ensure that all staff working
in your premises are too.

Smoking on
licensed premises
In England, it is a requirement
by law to display at least one
easy-to-read ‘No Smoking’ sign
in premises, although a premises
may display more than one sign
if the owner/manager feels that
this is necessary.
In Wales, it is a requirement to
display at least one ‘No Smoking’
50

sign. There are no requirements
on the location of the signs.
The only requirement is that the
sign contains a legible graphic
representation of a burning
cigarette enclosed in a circle
which crosses the cigarette
symbol.
Failure to display such signs
can result in a fixed penalty
fine of £200 (reduced to £150 if
paid within 15 days from issue)
or, in case of prosecution and
conviction, a maximum fine
of £1,000.
If you are the person in control
of a premises and allow a person
to smoke, you can be fined up
to £2,500. Anyone smoking on
smoke-free premises may have
to pay a fixed penalty of £30
(rising to £50 if not paid within
15 days) or a fine of £200 in
the case of prosecution and
conviction.
Smoking shelters can be put
up outside, but it is important
to find out if you need planning
permission before doing so.
It is the responsibility of the
premises licence holder to
ensure that the licensing
objectives are upheld and that
no public nuisance is created by
those using any smoking shelter
provided. A smoking shelter
must be no more than 50%
enclosed.

Drugs on licensed premises
Misuse of drugs is an incident
which could occur on any type of
premises. It is against the law to
turn a ‘blind eye’ to drug activity.
If this activity is allowed to
occur, the result may be a
review of the premises licence
and/or the forfeiture of the
DPS’s personal licence.
It is important that premises
licence holders implement a
zero-tolerance policy in relation
to illegal drug activity. Staff
should be aware of this policy
and be trained to spot any

possible signs of drug taking or
drug dealing so that they can
report any suspicions that they
may have. If a premises licence
holder or DPS believes that their
premises is being used for drugrelated activity, they are strongly
advised to seek advice from
the police.
Under the Anti-Social Behaviour,
Crime and Policing Act 2014, the
police have the power to close
down any licensed premises
where dealing in or production
of Class A drugs (such as heroin,
cocaine and ecstasy) is taking
place or where there is serious
nuisance or disorder.
