3. Personal Licence
A personal licence allows a
person to sell, or authorise the
sale of, alcohol in England and
Wales. Where a personal licence
holder authorises others to sell
alcohol, records should be kept
of these authorisations. These
records can then be used as
evidence of due diligence should
the need arise.
All sales must be made in
accordance with the terms of the

premises licence where the sale
is taking place.
A person does not need to be
working in licensed premises
to hold a personal licence, and
an individual can hold only one
personal licence.
The application for a personal
licence must be made to the
licensing authority where
you live.

Determination and grant
of a personal licence
The local authority must grant
a personal licence application
if the applicant meets all of the
following criteria:
Criterion 1
The applicant is aged 18 or over
and entitled to work in the UK.
Criterion 2
The applicant possesses a
relevant accredited licensing
qualification such as the BIIAB
APLH (or NCPLH if taken before
31/3/2011).
Criterion 3
The applicant has not forfeited a
personal licence in the last
five years.
Criterion 4
Declare any convictions of a
relevant or foreign offence or
payment of an immigration
penalty.
The licensing authority must
inform both the applicant and
the Chief Officer of Police for the
area, in writing, that the licence
has been granted.
If the applicant fails to meet
1, 2 or 3 above, then the
licensing authority must reject
the application. If an applicant
has had their personal licence
forfeited or revoked they cannot
apply for a personal licence for a
period of five years.

If the applicant meets 1, 2 and 3
above, but fails to meet criterion
4, the licensing authority must
notify the Chief Officer of Police
for the area and/or Home Office
(Immigration Enforcement).
The police or Home Office
(Immigration Enforcement) have
the power to object to someone
having a personal licence if
that person fails to meet the
relevant or foreign offence or
immigration penalty criteria.
The Chief Officer of Police or
Home Office (Immigration
Enforcement) has 14 days from
notification to object if they
believe that granting the licence
would undermine the prevention
of crime licensing objective. If
there is no objection then the
licence will be issued.
A personal licence is valid
indefinitely.
If a person is convicted of a
relevant or foreign offence or
required to pay an immigration
penalty during the application
period, the licensing authority
considering the application must
be told straightaway. Failure
to do this is a criminal offence
which carries a fine of no more
than £2,500 (Level 4).
Should the licensing authority
find out that a personal licence
holder has not informed them
of a conviction of a relevant or
foreign offence or immigration
penalty before or after the grant,
13

the personal licence may be
suspended for up to six months,
or it may be revoked. If the
relevant licensing authority is
considering whether to suspend
or revoke the licence, the
authority must give notice to
the personal licence holder.
A personal licence holder who
is charged with an offence must
tell the court dealing with the
offence that they hold a personal
licence no later than their first
appearance in court.
If a personal licence holder is
convicted of a relevant offence,
the court may order that the
licence is suspended (for up to
six months) or that it is forfeited
completely. Some examples of
relevant offences are:
i. An offence under either
the Licensing Act 1964 or
Licensing Act 2003

ii. Offences relating to driving
under the influence of
alcohol or drugs
iii. Firearms offences
iv. Sex offences
v. Theft
vi. Dealing in smuggled goods.
A relevant offence is any offence
listed in Schedule 4 of the
Licensing Act. Full details can be
found online at: legislation.gov.
uk/ukpga/2003/17/schedule/4
The term ‘foreign offence’ means
an offence (other than a relevant
offence) under the law of any
place outside England and Wales
that is equivalent to, although
not exactly the same as, a
relevant offence.
Some convictions have a period
of time after which they are
‘spent’, which means that under
law they are no longer counted
against the offender. However,
there are certain offences which
are never spent.
