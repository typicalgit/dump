11. Unauthorised LicensableActivities and Due Diligence
It is against the law to carry out
any licensable activity without
the appropriate licence, or to
knowingly allow it to happen.
Any activities that take place on
licensed premises must do so in
accordance with the conditions
on either the:
Premises Licence
or the
Club Premises Certificate
or a
Temporary Event Notice
An unauthorised licensable
activity could be:
i. An unlicensed ‘drinking den’
ii. Activities happening that are
not covered by the terms
of the premises licence,
club premises certificate or
Temporary Event Notice
iii. Breaking the conditions of
the premises licence, e.g.
sales of alcohol that take
place outside the hours that
the premises licence permits,
or providing regulated
entertainment where
only the sale of alcohol is
authorised.

The offence could result in a
maximum penalty of:
Six months in prison and/or
an unlimited fine
If charged, a person may apply
the defence of ‘due diligence’,
which means that they have
to prove that under the
circumstances in which the
law was broken:
What happened was a mistake
or
They were reliant on the
actions of another person
or
These were circumstances
beyond their control
AND
That all reasonable precautions
were taken to avoid committing
the offence
