Turning in the sea
Aviation directed at planetary orbiters
Touching Nice
}Leak me a way to the sea
Oh, Perforated Evening
The lovely puddles of Scottish Nessie holes
Arrive all you believers
A Brit in the Big Apple
Unknown place over the ocean
Waltzing in the evening's glow
Hello Karen and Graham's dog, hello
Firmer, Upgraded, Quicker, Tougher
Word is, things are different here at night
The solo ticker band of the Warrent Officer
Wobble it away
Royal Murderer
The roof won't contain this group
ZZ
